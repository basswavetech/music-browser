# Music Browser

This will be an overengineered backend in Go to show that I can work with Go,
SQL, Redis, Docker, JSON, and gRPC.

The idea is to create a client-server web app that can browse music from 
Youtube Music, Spotify and Bandcamp in one place, as well as download it using
yt-dlp, convert into a different format with ffmpeg, and then browse and listen
to the downloaded music.
